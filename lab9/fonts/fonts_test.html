            To be, or not to be that is the question<br>
            Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
            The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune<br>

            That flesh is heir to. Tis a consummation<br>
            Devoutly to be wishd. To die to sleep.<br>
            To sleep perchance to dream ay, theres the<br>
            rub! For in that sleep of death what dreams<br>
            may come When we have shuffled off this<br>
            mortal coil, Must give us pause. Theres the<br>
            respect. That makes calamity of so long<br>
            life. For who would bear the whips and<br>
            scorns of time, Th oppressors wrong, the<br>
            proud mans contumely. The pangs of despis'd<br>
            love, the laws delay. The insolence of<br>
            office, and the spurns That patient merit of<br>
            th' unworthy takes, When he himself might<br>
            his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who<br>
            would these fardels bear, To grunt and sweat<br>
            under a weary life, But that the dread of<br>
            something after death <br>
